This crate provides a serde [`Serializer`][__link0] and [`Deserializer`][__link1] implementation for the S-Expression data format used by KiCAD. Since this format differs in some central aspects from other formats like JSON, there are some limitations and special cases you should be aware of:

 - The name of your struct matters. For a simple struct like
	
	
	```rust
	#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
	struct Point(i32, i32);
	```
	
	and an example value `Point(1, 2)` you will get a JSON representation of `[1, 2]` whereas this crate will output `(Point 1 2)`.
	
	
 - The name of the fields also matters if the fieldâ€™s type is either a boolean, a tuple or a sequence. These fields cannot appear in unnamed containers (i.e. tuple structs).
	
	
 - Deserializing `Option` is not supported, because we need to know the type inside the option to determine if it is present or missing. To deserialize optional values, use the custom deserializing logic from this crate:
	
	
	```rust
	#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
	struct Position {
	    x: i32,
	    y: i32,
	    #[serde(with = "serde_kicad_sexpr::Option")]
	    rotation: Option<i32>
	}
	```
	
	
 - If you need to deserialize some sort of container with an unknown number of children, use a special field with an empty name, like so:
	
	
	```rust
	#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
	struct Point(i32, i32);
	
	#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize)]
	struct Polygon {
	    #[serde(default, rename = "")]
	    points: Vec<Point>
	}
	```
	
	Note that this has to be the last field of the struct. There must not be any fields after a field with an empty name, and there must only be one field with an empty name.
	
	
 - Untagged enums are not supported. If you need to parse one from a number of types, use the [`untagged!`][__link2] macro:
	
	
	```rust
	serde_kicad_sexpr::untagged! {
	    enum TextOrNumber {
	        Text(String),
	        Int(i32),
	        Float(f32)
	    }
	}
	```
